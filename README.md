# Employee-Directory

Introduction:  This is a web-based application that allows the user to view an entire employee directory at once so that they may have quick access to basic information.

Upon page load the application uses an axios API call to randomuser.me to populate the page with 1000 random names (employees).  Each employee's information is contained within a row of a table under the column headers of: first name, last name, phone, email, and gender.  There is a search bar at the top of the page that will allow the user to search for a specific employee by either their first or last name.  The user can also click on the "sort employees by last name button" which will re-render the list alphabetically by last name.

This application was created with React and styled with Bootstrap.
